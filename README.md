# monodraw-contract-snippets
💅 Community-managed library of Monodraw snippets that are used in smart contracts.

> **Note**
Monodraw does not have all the needed shapes customization features so some of the snippets are hardcoded to a reasonable sizes. Some headers as `Solady`, will have hardcoded borders. It's still easy to customize the snippets and save them locally for further usage though.

## 😤 Motivation
There are many cool Solidity libraries code of which is enhanced by splitting the smart contracts by logical sections.

Such sections usually start with a specific header and I believe that there is a competition to some degree who makes the most beatufiul one.

However using this app may give more benefits to Solidity programmers rather then just a section library.

Tables, diagrams, payload snippets will also be available to use.
